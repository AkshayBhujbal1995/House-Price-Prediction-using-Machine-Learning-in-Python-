# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

1. **Id**: Unique identifier for each record.
2. **MSSubClass**: Type of dwelling involved in the sale.
3. **MSZoning**: General zoning classification of the sale.
4. **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
5. **LotConfig**: Configuration of the lot.
6. **BldgType**: Type of dwelling.
7. **OverallCond**: Rating of the overall condition of the house.
8. **YearBuilt**: Original construction year.
9. **YearRemodAdd**: Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions).
10. **Exterior1st**: Exterior covering on the house.
11. **BsmtFinSF2**: Type 2 finished square feet.
12. **TotalBsmtSF**: Total square feet of basement area.
13. **SalePrice**: Target variable to be predicted.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on the provided features. By doing so, it aims to assist individuals in making informed decisions while buying or selling houses.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Development**: Training various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms to predict house prices.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve predictive accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Deploying the final model for real-time predictions or integration into existing systems.
